## Coding carried out for the structures team at work

This repository contains coding I have caried out for the structures team in Hertford. It contains a notebook for combining data sources to calculate priority scores for structural assessment, plotting the breakdown of structures in the county, and plotting structures on an interactive map to visualise the priority scores and their location in the county.
